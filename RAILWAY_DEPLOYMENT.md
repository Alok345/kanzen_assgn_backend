# Railway Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Database**: Set up a MySQL database (Railway, PlanetScale, or similar)
3. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be in a GitHub repository

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your repository
5. Set the **Root Directory** to `backend`

### 2. Set Environment Variables

In your Railway project settings, add these environment variables:

#### Required Database Variables:
```
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_USER=your-database-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_NAME=your-database-name
DB_PORT=3306
```

#### Optional Variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

### 3. Database Setup Options

#### Option A: Railway MySQL Plugin
1. In your Railway project, click "New"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "MySQL"
3. Railway will automatically set the database environment variables
4. Copy the connection details to your backend service

#### Option B: External Database (PlanetScale, etc.)
1. Get your database connection details
2. Manually set the environment variables in Railway

### 4. Deploy

1. Railway will automatically detect the Node.js project
2. It will install dependencies and start the server
3. The health check will run at `/api/health`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Health Check Fails**
   - Check that all database environment variables are set
   - Verify database connection details
   - Check Railway logs for error messages

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Ensure database is accessible from Railway
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify database credentials

3. **Build Failures**
   - Check that `package.json` is in the backend directory
   - Verify all dependencies are listed in `package.json`

### Checking Logs:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check the logs for error messages
